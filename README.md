### Development Guideline

1. Test Driven Development
2. Coding Guideline (For further information please visit this [link](https://source.android.com/source/code-style))
   - Never write a code that doesn't handle an exception, always make sure that you catch every exception and
   give some feedback to user when that happen (Exception handling)
   
   ```java
   /** Set port. If value is not a valid number, 80 is substituted. */
   
   void setServerPort(String value) {
       try {
           serverPort = Integer.parseInt(value);
       } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
           serverPort = 80;  // default port for server
       }
   }
   ```
   
   - When handling exception, make sure that you doesn't use Generic Exception as a way to catch those exception,
   unless you doesn't sure what kind of error will be raised on the code
   
   ```java
   try {
       gettingDatafromAPI();        // may throw HttpException
       convertDataToJSON();   // may throw ParsingException
       calculateItAndReturn();  // may throw NumberFormatException
       // phew, made it all the way
   } catch (Exception e) {                 // I'll just catch all exceptions
       handleError();                      // with one generic handler!
   }   
   ```
   
   - When you importing some module or package, use full path import so we can make sure what package are imported,
   unless it's come from Java Standard Library
   
   ```java
      import android.support.v4.app.*; //Doesn't know which pacakage is needed, so it's bad
      import android.support.v4.app.Fragment //Fragment with compat support is imported
      ```
   
   - Use proper Naming Convention
   
   ```java
      public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42; //For Final variable, use all Uppercase Letter
      private static MyClass sSingleton; //When using staticm use s at the beginning of name
      private int mPrivate; // When using non-public/non-static, use m at the beginning of name
      public int publicField; //Others, use lowercase at first word
   
   ```
   - Use TODO Comments when you're creating a temporary solution (line of code, or function) to make
   an understanding to next developer that this function needs some fixing

3. Clean Code (I'll only write some main points that I think it's important to remember, for further information, please read Books about Clean Code)
    
    1. Create a **Meaningfull Names** when you create a function, class, or variable
    2. Create a **Function that handle 1 specific task** instead of 1 function for many task
    3. Create a **Comments** for every important parts of code, to make an easier understanding of code
    4. Create a **Code that Self Explained** to make the code easier to read
    5. Create many **Small Function** when solving some problem is easier to do rather than creating 
    1 large function. It's also easier to maintain if you have this kind of function

We Prepare a VM for you, if you think that you need it for solving some task (such as creating additional
backend, or creating a proxy API)
